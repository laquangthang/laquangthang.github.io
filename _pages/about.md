I am a final graduate student at [SchooL of Economic Mathematics - Statistics](https://sems.ueh.edu.vn/) University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City.
My major is Bussiness Statistics,....

My current work in [Prof. Vivek Shenoyâ€™s research group](https://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu) at Penn focuses on [DNA architecture](/dissertation/) 
-- it's fascinating to me how 6 feet of DNA packs into a volume smaller than the head of a pin. 
I am writing high-performance code in C++ and data analysis scripts in Python to look more closely at important structures called 
lamin-associated domains (LADs). 

Earlier in my PhD, I developed my computational skills studying the electronic structure of [2D materials](/projects/mx_project)
and [applying machine learning](/projects/mp_project) to guide materials searches -- see my [projects](/projects/) section for more.

I feel energized when I can use my programming skills to [teach others](/teaching/) about math and science. 
I am planning a machine learning workshop for graduate students at Penn this spring!

Next, I want to find a role where I can make an impact building scalable systems to tackle big data challenges.
